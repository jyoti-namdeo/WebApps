# WebApps

In this project we are to use oracle java 1.8  for installation and there has to be Mongodb3.0 that is to be installed.

LINES OF CODE :4216

The mongo server should be hosted on 
server:localhost
port:27017
 
You would be needing apache-tomcat-7.0.34 as the server to deploy that application.

We assume you have installed apache-tomcat-7.0.34 in the <C:\apache-tomcat-7.0.34>.

The application name is PizzaParty which is saved as a zipfile. Extract that and place that in
<C:\apache-tomcat-7.0.34\webapps\PizzaParty>.

Run the ENV  file that is there under C:\apache-tomcat-7.0.34\webapps\PizzaParty\env-setup-for-tomcat.bat>

Start the tomcat application  in <C:\apache-tomcat-7.0.34\bin\startall.bat>

In your browser run <http://localhost/PizzaParty/MainPage>
